Status of the project
=====================

I'm supporting this fork of the unmantained [original project](https://github.com/crobi/rpg-cards) in my spare time.
PR's are still welcome, so feel free to implement new awesome features!

FAQ
=====================

- What browsers are supported?
  - A modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari). The generator has some issues on IE.
- Cards are generated without icons and background colors, what's wrong?
  - Enable printing backround images in your browser print dialog
- I can't find an icon that I've seen on [game-icons.net](http://game-icons.net), where is it?
  - See the section "updating icons" below.
- The layout of the cards is broken (e.g., cards are placed outside the page), what's wrong?
  - Check your page size, card size, and cards/page settings. If you ask the generator to place 4x4 poker-sized cards on a A4 paper, they won't fit and they will overflow the page.
